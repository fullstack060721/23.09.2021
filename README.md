# NodeJS_Swagger
ExpressJS CRUD application and document it using Swagger.  We'll use swagger-jsdoc to write the specs and express-swagger-ui to show the Swagger interface

    npm init --yes
    npm install express
    npm install body-parser
    
to use js doc syntax to write the swagger specification
    
    npm install swagger-jsdoc
    
    
to serve the swagger UI in our express app  
    
    npm install swagger-ui-express
    
## Accessing the Docs

With your local server running, the generated docs are available here: http://localhost:3000/api-docs

Iâ€™m going to supply this [ready-to-use example](https://github.com/MarizzaM/Node_Express_Api_for_Swagger) that you must clone to your local machine before proceeding to implementation.
